- you can also append to the end of the line by hitting `$` before the `A`

- hello you can input x amount of chars at once with: `<x>` `i` `<char>`  rgoodbye 

- you can replace x amount of chars with a char by highlighting the text then `r` `<char>`


### Capture groups

#### using vimgrep

You can use vimgrep to capture some text that matches a particular regex.

`:vimgrep /['"]github[^'"]*['"]/ %`

#### using a global search and replace.

You can define a capture group like this `/\(my_capture_group\)/`

For example for all lines that have `hello`. Highlight the lines you want to run the search and replace command on and then
`:s/\(.*hello.*\)/\1 \r goodbye`. The 1 represents the text we subbed out.
