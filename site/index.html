    >Hi, I'm vhs ðŸ‘‹ - here I write notes, thoughts, hacks and copy paste about
    things I find out or learn that are worth sharing or jotting down for later
    reference. My main interests these days are around functional programming,
    linux, nix, haskell, javascript and web developement. If you'd
    like to discuss, correct or ask, open an issue on
